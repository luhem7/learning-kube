# learning-kube
The goal of this repo is to build knowledge in these technologies incrementally by working on a project.

This is a learning repository for **Podman, Kubernetes (k8s), and React**. However, rather than building a series of examples, we will focus on creating an end to end application that demonstrates these technologies in a cohesive manner.

## Project Overview
Our goal is to build a full stack application that servers up a website that can be used to run cellular automata in the web browser.


## Learning Phases:
1. [podman](docs/podman.md)
2. kubernetes
3. react
